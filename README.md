# SyntheticData

Generating synthetic data from real data that will reproduce random data.

Using the following models:

* Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)
* Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
* SynthPop Non-Parametric (SP-NP)
* Synthetic Data Vault with Gaussian Copula (SDV-G)
* Synthetic Data Vault with Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (SDV-GAN)
* Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and
* Data Synthesizer (DS) 

Synthetic data are tested against the real data with evaluation techniques : Pairwise Correlation and SD-Metrics.
